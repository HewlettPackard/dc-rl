# DCRL-Green
DCRL-green is a framework for testing multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm that optimizes data centers for multiple objectives of carbon footprint reduction, energy consumption, and energy cost. It uses OpenAI Gym standard and supports modeling and control of three different types of problems: Carbon aware flexible load shifting, Data center HVAC cooling energy optimization and carbon aware battery auxiliary supply.
