In the video, you will see:
  - **Real-time plotting of agent variables:** Watch how the agents' actions and states are visualized dynamically
  - **Environment metrics:** Observe the DC's performance metrics, including energy consumption, cooling requirements, and workload distribution
  - **Interactive dashboard features:** Learn about the various interactive elements of the dashboard that allow for detailed analysis and monitoring

Evaluation Metrics
------------------------

Some of the evaluation metrics implemented in |F| include:

  - Carbon Footprint (CFP): Cumulative carbon emissions over the evaluation period.
  - HVAC Energy: Energy consumed by the DC cooling system.
  - IT Energy: Energy consumed by the DC servers.
  - Water Usage: Efficient utilization of water for cooling.
  - Task Dropped: Number of dropped tasks due to workload scheduling.
