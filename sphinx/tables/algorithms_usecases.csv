Algorithms, differences and use-cases
**PPO vs. IPPO:**,"PPO is for single-agent setups, while IPPO suits multi-agent environments with independent learning"
**IPPO vs. MAPPO:**,"IPPO treats agents independently; MAPPO coordinates agents with a centralized value function, ideal for cooperative tasks"
**MAPPO vs. HAPPO:**,"Both use centralized value functions, but HAPPO is for heterogeneous agents with different capabilities"
**HAPPO vs. HATRPO:**,"HAPPO uses PPO-based updates; HATRPO adapts TRPO for more stable and robust policy updates in heterogeneous settings"
**HAPPO vs. HAA2C:**,"HAPPO is PPO-based; HAA2C extends A2C to multi-agent systems, offering stability and performance trade-offs"
**HAA2C vs. HAD3QN:**,"HAA2C is an actor-critic method; HAD3QN uses value-based learning with dueling and double Q-learning"
**HAD3QN vs. HASAC:**,"HAD3QN is value-based; HASAC uses entropy regularization for environments with continuous action spaces"
