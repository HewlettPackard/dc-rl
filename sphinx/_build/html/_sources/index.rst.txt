|F|
==========

|F| is a framework for testing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms that optimizes data center clusters in a hierarchical manner for multiple objectives of carbon footprint reduction, energy consumption, and energy
cost.

It uses OpenAI Gym standard and supports modeling and control of three different types of problems:

- Carbon-aware flexible load shifting
- Data center HVAC cooling energy optimization
- Carbon-aware battery auxiliary supply

Main contributions of |F|:

- the first OpenAI framework, to the best of our knowledge, focused on carbon footprint reduction for data center clusters
- support for hierarchical data center clusters modeling where users have flexibility in specifying the cluster architecture
- Modular design, i.e users can utilize pre-defined modules for load shifting, energy and battery or build their own
- Scalable architecture that allows multiple different types of modules and connections between them
- Robust data center model that provides in-depth customization to fit users' needs
- Provides pre-defined reward functions as well as interface to create custom reward functions
- Built-in mechanisms for reward shaping focused on degree of cooperation between the agents and level of prioritization of carbon footprint reduction versus other metrics such as energy cost
- Reward shaping through custom reward functions
- Built-in MARL algorithms, with ability to incorporate user-specified custom agents
