# Reporting and Fixing Security Issues

Please do not open GitHub issues or pull requests - this makes the problem immediately visible to everyone, including malicious actors.

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to
**[soumyendu.sarkar@hpe.com](soumyendu.sarkar@hpe.com)**. You will receive a response from
us within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon
as possible depending on complexity but historically within a few days.
